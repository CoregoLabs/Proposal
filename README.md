## Project Overview üìÑ

### Overview

- Corego is a marketplace and a set of tools for Coretime manipulation and data tracking, with the goal of making development on Polkadot faster, easier, more flexible, and as an end result cheaper.
- Corego is a project that builds upon the ideas presented in the Agile Coretime RFC. The project will be developed under the assumption that the functionality described in the RFC will be implemented within the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem.
  Given that the pallet containing all the logic presented in the RFC already exists, we will have the capability to undertake all the development outlined in this proposal.
